# Engauge

### Hey there

Say hello to **Engauge**, the website that gives teachers an objective view as to how they are teaching! Engauge is simple: we utilize __computer vision__, __machine learning__, and engagement tracking to provide teachers with a multidimensional index on students’ __stress levels, drowsiness, and engagement__.

Currently, the education system faces two challenges: __zoom fatigue__, and teachers' inability to gauge how engaged their students are in the online setting. Engauge scores a student’s engagement and stress on scales of 0-3, through their webcam! Teachers are then provided with the sum of these two scores, which is the __"learning ability index."__ Teachers are then able to gauge whether their teaching style is effective, or whether their students are dozing off into the seventh dimension. Furthermore, teachers will be held accountable for planning out lessons in order to prevent any reported zoom fatigue.

Engauge will revolutionize the education system, *one healthy student at a time!*
